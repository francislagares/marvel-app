# MARVEL App with Next.js

This README provides an overview of the MARVEL app built using Next.js 14
framework, following a specific architecture.

## Architecture Overview

The MARVEL app follows a modular architecture to ensure scalability,
maintainability, and organization of code. Here's a breakdown of the main
directories and their purposes:

#### `src`

- **app**: Contains modules related to the main functionalities of the app.
  - **characters**: Module for managing characters-related functionalities.
- **components**: Reusable UI components used across the app.
- **context**: Context providers for managing global state.
- **models**: Data models and types used within the application.
- **services**: API services for fetching data from external sources.
- **styles**: Stylesheets and styling utilities.
- **utils**: Utility functions used throughout the app.

## Directory Structure

```
src/
-- app/
 -- (characters)
    -- /favorites
    -- /search
    -- /styles
    layout.tsx
    page.tsx
 -- characters/[id]
    -- page.tsx
 error.tsx
 layout.tsx
 not-found.tsx

## Detailed Description

- **app/characters**: This module handles functionalities related to characters
  such character data, displaying character details, etc.
- **components**: This directory contains reusable UI components used throughout
  the application.
- **context**: Context providers are stored here to manage global state such as
  fetching characters data and storing characters as favorites.
- **models**: Data models and types used across the app are defined in this
  directory for type safety and consistency.
- **services**: API service files reside here, responsible for fetching data
  from external sources like the MARVEL API.
- **styles**: Stylesheets and styling utilities including global styles.
- **utils**: Utility functions that are used across multiple modules within the
  app.
